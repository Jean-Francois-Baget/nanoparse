# nanoparse

Work in progress. Clone the repository, then use `mvn clean compile`.

This is the parsing engine I will be using in DLGPE. For now, it is painful to use, error messages are minimal, but it is fast and will evolve later.

It is actually used in two other projects:
* irirefs
* nanoparsers
If you want to use any of those projects, first install nanoparse.

```
git clone "https://gitlab.inria.fr/jfbaget/nanoparse.git"
mvn clean compile
```
